To get started, have sword checked out at the same level as bishop, e.g.,

~/src/sword
~/src/bishop

##########  Prepare SWORD Cordova plugin ###############################
cd ~/src/sword/bindings/java-jni
make
cd ../Android
# run Android Studio and open project ~/src/sword/bindings/Android/SWORD
# once project is loaded, choose Build | Rebuild Project
# once building is complete, continue in shell...
make

##########  Build bishop ###############################

# first time after checkout

make setup
make refreshplatforms

make
#plug your phone in
make install

######### WARNING!!!!  The Makefile copies files from platforms/android/assets/www/ into www/ ###############
# I know this seems wrong, but it is right if you are using and IDE
# All Cordova support in IDEs that I've seen have you go into the platforms/
# folder and open the project files under there.  This means that if you
# run debug and edit from your IDE, you will be editing under the platforms/ folder
# so the Makefile copies source from there.  This just means that if you are NOT using
# an IDE, simply still edit the files in platform/android/assets/www/ instead of www/
# or change the Makefile to remove the 'copyfromplatform' target.
#
#########  Again, I realize this isn't ideal and I am guessing IDEs will become more aware of
# cordova/phonegap/ionic in the future and support projects at the root instead of
# under platforms/
